## Sweet spheres: Succession and CAZyme expression of marine bacterial communities colonising a mix of alginate and pectin particles 

Scripts & data to reproduce analysis & figures from Bunse et al. “Sweet spheres: Succession and CAZyme expression of marine bacterial communities colonising a mix of alginate and pectin particles” published at Environmental Microbiology  (url).

The repo contains input files and analysis code for 
- amplicon analysis 
- meta-omics

Large input files (e.g annotated contigs, protein-fasta files) and other relevant information (annotated MAGs, DNA-RNA extraction protocol) are deposited at XXX. Raw sequence data is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB38771.
