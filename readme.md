## Sweet spheres: Succession and CAZyme expression of marine bacterial communities colonizing a mix of alginate and pectin particles 

Scripts & data to reproduce analysis & figures from â€œSweet spheres" published by Bunse et al. in Environmental Microbiology (https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.15536).

The repo contains input files and analysis code for 
- amplicon analysis 
- meta-omics

Large input files (e.g RNA-seq & protein-fasta files) and other relevant information (e.g. annotated contigs & MAGs) are deposited at https://zenodo.org/record/4171148. Raw sequence data is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB38771.
